<em class="fas fa-stopwatch"></em><span class=reading-time>3-minute read</span></div></div><hr><h2 id=a-little-about-me>A little about me!</h2><p>My name is Temenu Ayomide Esther-Phebe but most people just call me just Phebe, my pronouns are she/her. I grew up and spent my entire life in the large, bustling city of Lagos and left for the city of Osun for my University education where I fell in love with the slow sleepy town of <em>Ile-Ife</em>. It is my life’s goal to settle in a slow, sleepy town and do my work.</p><p>I am an Outreachy intern, when I say that out loud it makes me giddy. I’m excited to be a part of something, a team. I am a part of the the 71 interns from different countries selected for the May 2021 round of the Outreachy 3 month internship.</p><p>I have a bunch of interests, I’d like to think my existence is a collection of interests. Primarily I love literature, African fiction holds a special place in my heart. I love music so much, in my head I’m a rockstar. I love YouTube; I watch cooking videos, DIY videos, Ted talks, dev videos, science experiments, home makeovers. I am deeply intrigued by the fact that whatever it is you’re trying to do, someone has made a YouTube tutorial covering it.</p><h2 id=core-values>Core Values</h2><p>“What are my core values?” I have asked myself this question over and over again since I saw the blog prompt. I know for sure that what holds me at my center is Love, Courage, Community.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Love</strong> - I believe that the work it takes for nothing to become something is love. Love spurs action, growth and change. The work to improve at my work and be a better person is tied into love. I’d like to believe that Outreachy started as an idea to give opportunities in tech to under-represented and typically passed over groups of people. Looking at other groups of people and thinking they deserve a shot is love. The work to build it from the ground up, set up a working structure and see it thrive is love. Love is compassion, loving people means that you see them and accept them for who they are.</p></li><li><p><strong>Courage</strong> - I have learnt that courage is not the absence of fear (I am afraid most of the time). Courage is still moving ahead even with the fear, putting on shaky foot in front of the other to keep moving forward to your dreams.</p></li><li><p><strong>Community</strong> - Nobody exists in a vacuum, communities are the backbone of society. Sometimes we get to pick our communities and other times we are thrust into communities.</p></li></ol><h2 id=outreachy>Outreachy</h2><p>A couple of my friends knew that I was looking for internship positions and one of them sent me the Outreachy link and told me to check it out. I read through the website and made a decision to apply. I had doubts that I was going to get through as I am a relatively new developer and I hadn’t contributed to Open Source before but I decided to try, even if I failed I would have done so while daring greatly.</p><p><a href=https://www.outreachy.org/>Outreachy</a> is a diversity initiative that provides paid, remote internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living. Outreachy interns work on open source projects, it is split into 3 phases; the initial application, the contribution phase and the 3 month internship.</p><p>The contribution phase was challenging and absolutely amazing. I got to learn about new technologies and work with the mentors and other contributors. I will be working with <a href=https://odk-x.org/>ODK-X Tools</a>, contributing to the documentation and trying to improve the learning paths for new and existing users. I have come to appreciate each one of the tools in the ODK-X tool suite and I look forward to an amazing internship.</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=tag href=/tags/outreachy/>outreachy</a></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=/js/medium-zoom.min.83cb1dd5fea8d42d87d1e601a07faa73089ad0ef9ccfe5daf6041289ebcc4e46.js integrity="sha256-g8sd1f6o1C2H0eYBoH+qcwia0O+cz+Xa9gQSievMTkY=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
